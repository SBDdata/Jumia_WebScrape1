# Jumia_WebScrape1
## by Oluwaseun Bello

This is a  beginner friendly project for webscraping
> In this project, I scrapped data from [A jumia webpage](https://www.jumia.com.ng/vejaro-t10-mens-2-in-1-short-sleeve-t-shirt-shorts-set-whiteblack-95053134.html).
> I was able to define a function that sends me the name, price, and date of a particular shirt to see if there is a drop in price. 
> The function checks daily and adds the price of that day as a row in a csv file.
